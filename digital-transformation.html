      "Today, most companies struggle with the most simplistic of data questions: 
      Who is my customer? What have I sold them? What else might they need? With

      Digital transformation drives the engine of the company. "To do this, 
      leaders need to bring in tech and cultural changes that empower their
      employees, engage customers in new ways, optimize operations, and 
      transform products. Rebuilding an organization around these areas creates 
      a fully digital company that can change ahead of its customers and 
      competition."

      of this transformation than we would if we had just focused on one part 
      of the company."
