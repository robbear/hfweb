    <p>
      Digital transformation is every bit as revolutionary as the Industrial 
      Revolution. It's not a matter of if your company will transform. To 
      compete, you have to. Insightful business leaders understand it's a long 
      term journey that involves every operation and every employee. They 
      understand that while technology is important, the journey is also one of 
      defining culture.
