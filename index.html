      is every bit as revolutionary as the Industrial 
      Revolution. Insightful business leaders understand it's a long 
      term journey that involves every business operation and every employee. They 
      understand that while technology is important, the journey is one of 
      defining company culture and agile processes that lead to competitive
      improvements in profit margins.
